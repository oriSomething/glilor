# Glilor

Glilor is a typographic experiment of [ori livni](http://www.orilivni.com) and [alef alef alef](http://www.alefalefalef.co.il).
You can see it live [here](http://www.alefalefalef.co.il/a/glilor/).

## Notice

If you run it locally it will fail to load without the fonts which are missing. The reason they are missing, because they are copyright protected. You will have to buy them from [alef alef alef](http://www.alefalefalef.co.il) or replace it with your fonts which will need to update the files: `app/styles/modules/fonts.scss` and `config/environment.js`.
